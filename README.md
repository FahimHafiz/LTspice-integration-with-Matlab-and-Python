# LTspice-integration-with-Matlab-and-Python
In this work, I demonstrate how can we link circuits built in LTspice circuit simulator with MATLAB and Python. In this way, we can vary different parameters of the actual circuit using MATLAB and Python for analyzing the circuit without the need to make changes or even touch the circuits built in LTspice.
